    Lexi has short, fiery red hair and piercing blue eyes. She wears a black and orange costume that is adorned with flames.

Backstory: Lexi was once a happy and carefree college student, with a loving family and a bright future ahead of her. Tragedy struck when her parents and younger brother were killed in a brutal home invasion. The trauma of that event left Lexi with severe survivor's guilt and a deep-seated anger.

Origin Story: While trying to cope with her loss, Lexi discovered that she had developed the ability to control and manipulate fire. She learned to harness her powers and created a superhero alter ego, "Phoenix," to fight against the forces of evil that had destroyed her family.

Powers:

- Ability to control and manipulate fire
- Enhanced strength and agility
- Resistance to heat and flames

Personality: Lexi is fiercely determined and intensely passionate. As Phoenix, she is a force to be reckoned with, using her powers to protect the innocent and punish those who have escaped justice. But beneath the surface, she still grapples with the emotional scars of her past and the fear of losing those she cares about.

Personal Tragedy: Lexi's past continues to haunt her, and she often struggles with:

- Survivor's guilt
- Anger and rage
- Fear of loss and abandonment
- Difficulty forming close relationships
